# odin-recipe
This is my first project!

I will be creating a basic recipe blog/ website.

This will test my foundations of HTML. I am looking to utilize some of the tricks within HTML to make the page look decent, without being fully stylized with other languages. This includes lists, bold or italics, anchors and more.

Wish me luck!
