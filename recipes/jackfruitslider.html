        <h3>Jackfruit sliders that are simple and delicious!</h3>
            <p>First of all, my family and I <em>always</em> enjoy this recipe.
               It is a go to meal of ours during the summer when we want something light and simple.
               The ingredients list is short and accessible, so hopefully you and your family find this recipe as amazing as we do!</p>
            <p>These poppable bites are a treat.
                You can dress them up as much as you'd like or dress them down for quicker consumption.
                We love sauces and condiments so typically ours look like the picture above.
                You get so many different flavors, from the BBQ flavored jackfruit, to the sweetness of the slaw, everything is balanaced so well! <strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
